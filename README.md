# Vector
To implement a vector class


# ========================
# The Vector class
# ========================

# Write definitions for a class called Vector.
# Definition should include a constructor,  __str__, values for the x and y
# coordinates, and methods for addition and subtraction of vectors, scalar multiplication,
# length, and comparison.

class Vector(object):
    pass

# =========================
# The derived Complex class
# =========================

# Write definitions for a class called MyComplex that is derived from your
# Vector class.  Your definition should include methods for multiplying two
# complex numbers and computing the complex conjugate as well as an updated
# definition of __str__.

class MyComplex(Vector):
    pass
